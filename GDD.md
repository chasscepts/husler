# Trapped in a maze

- Our hero is trapped in a maze.
- He can collect silver and bronze coins that randomly appear (these disappear after some time).
- The gold coin is locked away in a room that is locked.
- The door to the gold room sometimes opens. (The game is timed and door should open at random times but opens a constant number of times in a game period)
- There are many rooms in the maze, some with 1 others with 2 doors. These doors can randomly close at any time.
- The villain is out to trap our hero in a room.
- The villan has an assistance who sometimes appears as an innocent coin.
- If our hero is able to collect the gold before time ellapses, his score is multiplied by 100.
- The odds of our being trapped if he just waits outside the gold room door should be made high.
- The game ends if
  1. Game time elapses.
  2. Our hero collides with the villain.
  3. Our hero collects the villain's assistance hidden in a coin.
- Silver and Bronze coins are worth 30 and 10 points each.
